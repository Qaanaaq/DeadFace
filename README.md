# DEADFACE

Using the Google Mediapipe I created and app from where blendshapes can be tracked. Two modes are available. 
In Video, from uploaded video  normalized Blendshape scores are written into a *.csv, a similar file than what Unreal Live Link is outputting. 
In Stream, data is livestreamd via UDP, and can be streamd into Blender, Unreal, perhaps Unity. 
In Blender it work especially well with the FACE-It plugin.

i gave this a lot of free time, after 10 000 downloads of my previous script, i received 0, so if you want to encourage me to make my work public:

I am a visual artist, and coding is only a means to achieve results i need, 
lot of the code was aided by ChatGPT, some of the code is directly used from https://github.com/JimWest and his MeFaMo, and PyLiveLinkFace
