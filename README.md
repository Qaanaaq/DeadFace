# DEADFACE

Using the Google Mediapipe I created and app from where blendshapes can be tracked. 
Two modes are available. 
In Video, from uploaded video normalized Blendshape scores are written into a *.csv, a similar file than what Unreal Live Link is outputting. You can use this in Blender (great) or Unreal (experimental). 
In Stream, data is livestreamd via UDP, and can be streamed into Blender, Unreal, perhaps Unity. 
In Blender it work especially well with the FACE-It plugin.

i gave this a lot of free time, after 10 000 downloads of my previous script, i received 0 coffies, so if you want to encourage me to make my work public:<br />

Also some of you have reported the antivirus flagging - that is because for an indy-developer i would need to purchase certtificates so that the .executable gets certified. Also because of the previous paragraph, that is not viable for me.  BUT if you are interested i can put a tutorial together how to build it with pyinstaller from source code. (some coffee would help motivation)

I am a visual artist, and coding is only a means to achieve results i need, lot of the code was aided by ChatGPT, some of the code is directly used from https://github.com/JimWest and his MeFaMo, and PyLiveLinkFace
